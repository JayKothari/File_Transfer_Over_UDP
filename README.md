# File_Transfer_Over_UDP
I have designed and implementated file trasnfer over udp unlike ftp over tcp. Though initally it handshake over tcp to give meta information of file to the server and then starts to transfer data over udp.

I have not completed the code. But still it work with one client and server. 

Try it. Till then I would try to improve the code. I am open for querys or suggestions.
